This is a my personal cms blog I've developed with PHP, MySQL, JavaScript/jQuery, Bootstrap.
The blog has a fully integrated admin panel that has CRUD features in regards to posts made by either other users or admins.
Comment's made by other users to posts can only be seen by regular users if the admin gives an approval from the admin panel. The creator
of the blog can be reached through the contact page as the message will be sent to the creator's email.
